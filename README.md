## About

WellPower upcycles solar panels and repurposed automobile lithium ion batteries — both of which would otherwise end up in landfills — to power a water pump and filtration system.What’s more, the unit is a self-contained power source that can be used for other needs, from refrigerating vaccines to dehydrating foods for storage, or it can be linked with other WellPower devices to create a power grid.
